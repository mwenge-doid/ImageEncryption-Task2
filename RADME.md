# 🔐 Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation

This project is part of my cybersecurity internship. It demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel-level manipulation in Python.

## 📁 Files Included

- `image_encryptor.py` – Main Python script for encryption and decryption
- `mwenge.jpg` – Original input image
- `encrypted_mwenge.jpg` – Output (encrypted) image

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypts an image by rearranging its pixel data.
- Decryption restores the original image.
- Built using the Python Pillow (PIL) library.

## 💻 How to Run

1. Install Pillow if you don’t have it:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
